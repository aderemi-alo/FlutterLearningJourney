# Flutter Learning Journey

This repository contains my progress as I learn Flutter. Each module represents a specific concept, and the projects demonstrate my implementation of the concepts.

## Structure
- `Module1_Fundamentals/`: Basic concepts of Flutter and Dart.
    - `day1_helloworld/` : Built a hello world application
    - `day2_dartexercises/`: Practiced dart essentials such as lists, variables, maps, oop, etc using exercises.
